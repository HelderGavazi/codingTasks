Hi Shingai,

I am writing this note to inform you that due to an unfortunate mistake, I have uploaded the wrong (draft code) file to my Dropbox to be submitted as my [Practical Task: - " email simulator"] work.
 
Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience caused and I hope you can again review my updated work (email.py).

Many thanks
Helder
